## 📝 Technical Decisions

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (chosen for Python alignment with CLAUDE.md standards)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (async support, modern patterns)
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 (strict mode, auto-validation)
- **Package Manager**: UV (blazing fast, modern Python tooling)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (robust, excellent for complex queries)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+ (functional components, hooks)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast dev server, optimized builds)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Drybar-inspired: yellow-400, gray tones, Georgia serif)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (consistent, modern icon set)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (declarative routing)

### Database Schema Highlights
- **Entity-specific primary keys**: `session_id`, `lead_id`, `message_id` (self-documenting)
- **Real-time tracking**: `inventory_movements` table logs every item movement
- **Smart returns**: `booking_items.return_warehouse_id` based on next booking
- **Conflict prevention**: Date overlap checking before booking confirmation

- None

### Potential Risks
- **Google Maps API**: Need to create new API key (previous one was deleted)
- **Stripe API**: Need test mode keys for payment integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Local install required before database work can begin
- **Complexity**: Return warehouse logic requires careful testing to ensure items go to correct location
