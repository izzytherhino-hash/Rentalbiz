# Phineas Fix - Make All Tools Autonomous

## Problem
Current approval system doesn't work because:
1. No state tracking - when user says "yes", system doesn't know what to approve
2. Technical IDs shown instead of natural language
3. Requires multiple back-and-forth messages

## Solution
Make ALL tools autonomous. Let Phineas explain actions naturally through conversation, then execute immediately.

## Changes Needed
1. Remove `tool_requires_approval()` check
2. Execute all tools automatically
3. Update system prompt to tell Phineas to explain actions naturally before executing
4. Phineas will say "I'll assign Thomas to Sarah's booking" then do it immediately

## Example Flow
**Old (broken)**:
- User: "assign Mike to Sarah's booking"
- Phineas: "**Action Proposed:** assign_driver_to_booking **Details:** {'booking_id': 'PTY-123', 'driver_id': 'abc-def'} Should I proceed?"
- User: "yes"
- Phineas: *nothing happens - no state tracking*

**New (working)**:
- User: "assign Mike to Sarah's booking"
- Phineas: *calls tool, gets booking/driver details* â†’ "I've assigned Mike Chen to handle the delivery for Sarah Martinez's party on October 28th. Done!"
